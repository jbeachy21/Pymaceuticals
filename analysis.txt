One thing that sticks out to me is that the Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimen were perhaps the most effective since the mean volume of all tumors treated with Capomulin and Ramicane were the lowest.  A second thing that sticks out to me it that there were significantly more mice treated with both Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimens which perhaps caused a lower mean of tumor volumes to occur.  This could be interesting to look into further since all other drug regimens were averaging tumor volumes in the low 50's.  Finally, while it remains to be seen whether more treatment with Capomulin and Ramicane makes for a lower mean tumor volume, these two drug regimens were used on the most unique mice.
